# Full Stack Banking App with React

## Description/Motivation

### This is the capstone project for my Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN. Students were tasked with creating a banking app meeting the following criteria:

### - Front end styling
### - A Node.js server
### - A MongoDB database
### - A DAL
### - API integration
### - Connection between the front end and the backend
### - Authentication
### - Deployment to a cloud service

## Installation Guidelines

### Installing and running this banking application locally is a snap.

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jmmount/badbank3.git
```
### 2. Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
### 3. Run the application on localhost://3000
```bash
node index.js
```

## Additional Features

### If you would like to use the database feature you will need to create an Connection String by creating an account on [MongoDB](https://account.mongodb.com/account/register?_ga=2.104161920.1248733531.1703200375-1815639311.1701036509)

### You can add the connection sting to [dal.js](./dal.js)
#### You will need to create a .env file to store your [MONGO_URI]()
